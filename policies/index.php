	All “New Friends” who meet the criteria, will meet with the Nanny prior to their scheduled stay to ensure everyone is comfortable with each other. Please allow 30 minutes.

	All dogs must be spay or neutered and current on vaccines. We require Rabies and Bordetella. (Puppies are the exception.)

	Due the delicate stress levels of these pets, the Nanny is unable to accept cats, reptiles or fish.

	Unfortunately, the Nanny is unable to accept certain breeds of dogs due the specifications of our insurance company.
